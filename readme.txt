== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What types of charts can you create with Syntegrate Chart? =

You can create parts-of-a-whole charts like doughnut and pie charts, or x-y axis charts like bar, column, spline, line and bubble charts.

= Do I need an additional Salesforce license to be able to use Syntegrate Chart? =

Syntegrate Chart can connect to Salesforce using any existing Salesforce.com license. All you need is a username, password and security token and you're in. 

= What type of Salesforce account do I need to use Syntegrate Chart? =

Syntegrate Chart can create charts based on any of the data available to your Salesforce account. So, for example, if you use a Salesforce Platform account to connect, you won't be able to create charts based off of opportunities or forecasts. Click [here](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=users_license_types_available.htm&language=en_US "Salesforce licenses") to learn more about the different types of Salesforce licenses.

= Is there a limit to the number of reports I can run? =

Syntegrate Chart connects to Salesforce.com via the Salesforce API (Application Programming Interface). Each Salesforce license is entitled to a certain number of API calls in a 24-hour period. Each refresh of a chart's data would result in a single API call. Also, each modification of a chart's source object would result in a call as well.
